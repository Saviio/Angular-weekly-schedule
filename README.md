# Fermi - UI

A simple UI library implementation using AngularJS.


1. Lang: ES6 & part feature of ES7
2. Dependencies: AngularJS
3. Build Tool: webpack

> The reason of "Fermi" is that when I create this library, NASA just found the kepler-452b. That reminded me the famous paradox which was raised by Fermi.

> We're afraid to be alone, but we're hoping for peace as well.
