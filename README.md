# Fermi.UI

A simple UI library implementation using angular.js.


1. Lang: ES6 & part of ES7
2. Dependencies: Angular1
3. Build Tool: Webpack

> The reason of "Fermi" is that when I create this library, NASA just found the kepler-452b. That remind me Fermi raised a paradox long time ago: "Where is everybody?"
